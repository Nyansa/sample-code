# Contributing Guidelines

For anyone looking to get involved to this project, we are glad to hear from you. Here are a few types of contributions
that we would be interested in hearing about.

*  Bug Fixes
    -  If you find a bug, please first report it using Github Issues.
    -  Issues that have already been identified as a bug will be labelled `bug`.
    -  If you'd like to submit a fix for a bug, send a Pull Request from your own fork and mention the Issue number.
*  New Features
    -  If you'd like to accomplish something in the library that it doesn't already do, describe the problem in a new
       Github Issue.
    -  Issues that have been identified as a feature request will be labelled `enhancement`.
    -  If you'd like to implement the new feature, please wait for feedback from the project maintainers before spending
       too much time writing the code. In some cases, `enhancement`s may not align well with the project objectives at
       the time.
*  Documentation and Miscellaneous
    -  If you think the documentation could be clearer, if you've got an alternative
       implementation of something that may have more advantages, or if there is any other change,
       we would still be glad hear about it.
       -  If it's a trivial change, go ahead and send a Pull Request with the changes you have in mind.
       -  If not, open a Github Issue to discuss the idea first.
